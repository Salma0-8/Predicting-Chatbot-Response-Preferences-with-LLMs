# Chatbot Preference Prediction Using LLMs

## Overview
I developed a sophisticated machine learning model utilizing advanced large language models (LLMs) to predict user preferences in chatbot interactions.
I implemented a comprehensive data preprocessing pipeline, including feature extraction and encoding, to optimize model performance.
Furthermore, I conducted extensive hyperparameter tuning and model evaluation to enhance accuracy and interpretability.
This work contributes to the advancement of AI-driven conversational systems, aligning with user-centric design principles.

## StoryTelling

**Chapter 1: The Challenge Begins – A Call to the Arena**
Imagine a virtual stadium where chatots of all kinds come to compete. Its called **The Chatbot Arena**. Here, each day, countless LLM-powered bots face off in head-to-head battles, each trying to win the favor of judges whos choose the most satistfying response to a user prompt. Its a modern gladiator battle of AI: LLMs compete not with swords and shields but with words, ideas and clever responses.
In this arena, one thing becomes clear: user want chatbots that "get them" responding in ways the resonate and meet their expectations. However, despite their power, LLMs have quirks they can be verbose, biased towards the first response they see, and sometimes too self-promotional. The challenge is to create a model that can see through these biases, anticipate user prefernces, and predict which response will emerage victorious  in the arena.
And so, the call to action is clear. Build a model that can foresee user preferences, a model that understaands the subtle art of what users prefer in conversations.

**Chapter 2: The Journey Begins – Gathering Insights**
We begin with data from the arena, Its vast: 55,000 rows of conversations from Chatbot Arena, each row containing:
- A prompt--a question or request made by a user.
- Two responses from different LLMs.
- The wining response, chosen by the judge, and ant ties.

The task is simple in concept but complex in excution: predict which response will win each time. To begin, we explore the data, identify patterns, and develop an intuition about what makes responses appealing. Our goal: turn these insights into features that capture the essence of a winning response.

**Chapter 3: Crafting the Model – Building the AI Guide**
To bring the magic of perdiction to life, we turn to **NLP(Natural Langauage Processing)** tools and advanced **Machine learning Models**. We build features such as the length of each response, the sentiment, the structure, and even the word choice that might sway a judge's preference. We consider biases in the data and creat adjustments to help the model see the truth beneath.
Our model might be a **Transformer Model Fine-Tuned to understand dialogue** or a carefully crafted ensemble. Each decision, each feature, is aimed at reducing the noise, biases, and quirks of the data, leading us closer to an accurate prediction.
The model, once just an idea, becomes a blend of algorithms, and after many iterations, we see it taking shape. Its predictions are getting closer to reality, inching toward the goal: achieving an optimal **log loss score**.
